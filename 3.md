  - Site-to-site
    - "Site-to-site communication links are network connections that connect two or more networks across an intermediary network layer." (Conklin)
  - Remote access
    - "Remote access via a tunnel or VPN has the same effect as directly connecting the remote system to the network—it’s as if the remote user just plugged a network cable directly into her machine." (Conklin)
- Security device/technology placement ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yDrpQWBz6M&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=70))
  - Sensors
    - "Sensors are devices that capture data and act upon it... They can report on what they observe, they can use multiple readings to match a pattern and create an event, and they can act based on proscribed rules." (Conklin)
  - Collectors
    - "Collectors are sensors, or concentrators that combine multiple sensors that collect data for processing by other systems." (Conklin)
  - Correlation engines
    - "Correlation engines take sets of data and match the patterns against known patterns." (Conklin)
  - Filters
    - "Packet filters process packets at a network interface based on source and destination addresses, ports, or protocols, and either allow passage or block them based on a set of rules." (Conklin)
  - Proxies
    - "Proxies are servers that act as a go-between between clients and other systems; in essence, they are designed to act on the clients’ behalf." (Conklin)
  - Firewalls
    - "Firewalls at their base level are policy enforcement engines that determine whether traffic can pass or not based on a set of rules." (Conklin)
  - VPN concentrators
    - "A VPN concentrator takes multiple individual VPN connections and terminates them into a single network point." (Conklin)
  - SSL accelerators
    - "An SSL accelerator is used to provide SSL/TLS encryption/decryption at scale, removing the load from web servers." (Conklin)
  - Load balancers
    - "Load balancers take incoming traffic from one network location and distribute it across multiple network operations." (Conklin)
  - DDoS mitigator
    - "DDoS mitigators by nature must exist outside the area that they are protecting. They act as an umbrella, shielding away the unwanted DDoS packets." (Conklin)
  - Aggregation switches
    - "An aggregation switch is a switch that provides connectivity for several other switches. Think of it as a one-to-many type of device. It’s the one switch that many other switches connect to." (Conklin)
  - Taps and port mirror
    - "Most enterprise switches have the ability to copy the activity of one or more ports through a Switch Port Analyzer (SPAN) port, also known as a port mirror. This traffic can then be sent to a device for analysis." (Conklin)
    - "A Test Access Point (TAP) is a passive signal-copying mechanism installed between two points on the network. The TAP can copy all packets it receives, rebuilding a copy of all messages. TAPs provide the one distinct advantage of not being overwhelmed by traffic levels, at least not in the process of data collection." (Conklin)
- SDN ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ysxl3qzaSZ0&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=71))
  - "Software-defined networking (SDN)... enables network engineers to reconfigure the network by making changes via a software program, without the need for re-cabling. SDN allows for network function deployment via software." (Conklin)

## 3.3 Given a scenario, implement secure systems design.

  - TPM
    - "The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a hardware solution on the motherboard, one that assists with key generation and storage as well as random number generation. When the encryption keys are stored in the TPM, they are not accessible via normal software channels and are physically separated from the hard drive or other encrypted data locations." (Conklin)
  - HSM
    - "A hardware security module (HSM) is a device used to manage or store encryption keys. It can also assist in cryptographic operations such as encryption, hashing, or the application of digital signatures. HSMs typically are peripheral devices..." (Conklin)
  - UEFI/BIOS
    - "Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is the current replacement for BIOS. UEFI offers significant modernization over the decades-old BIOS, including the capability to deal with modern peripherals such as high-capacity storage and high-bandwidth communications." (Conklin)
  - Secure boot and attestation
    - "Secure Boot is a mode that, when enabled, only allows signed drivers and OS loaders to be invoked." (Conklin)
    - "Secure Boot enables the attestation that the drivers and OS loaders being used have not changed since they were approved for use." (Conklin)
  - Supply chain
    - "In today’s world of global manufacturing with global outsourcing, attempting to identify all the suppliers in a hardware manufacturer’s supply chain, which commonly changes from device to device, and even between lots, is practically futile in most cases." (Conklin)
  - Hardware root of trust
    - "A hardware root of trust is a concept that if one has a trusted source of specific secu- rity functions, this layer can be used to promote security to higher layers of a system... Examples of roots of trust include TPM chips in computers and Apple’s Secure Enclave coprocessor in its iPhones and iPads." (Conklin)
  - EMI/EMP
    - "Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is an electrical disturbance that affects an electrical circuit. EMI is due to either electromagnetic induction or radiation emitted from an external source..." (Conklin)

    - "Having systems properly configured prior to use can limit the number of user caused incidents." (Conklin)
  - Trusted operating system
    - "A trusted operating system is one that is designed to allow multilevel security in its opera- tion. This is further defined by its ability to meet a series of criteria required by the U.S. government." (Conklin)
  - Application whitelisting/blacklisting
    - "Application blacklisting is essentially noting which applications should not be allowed to run on the machine... Application whitelisting is the exact opposite: it consists of a list of allowed applica- tions." (Conklin)
  - Disable default accounts/passwords

  - Continuous integration
    - "Continuous integration is the DevOps manner of continually updating and improving the production code base." (Conklin)
  - Baselining
    - "Baselining is the process of determining a standard set of functionality and performance. This is a metrics-driven process, where later changes can be compared to the baseline to gauge their impact on performance and other variables." (Conklin)
  - Immutable systems
    - "An immutable system is a system that, once deployed, is never modified, patched, or upgraded. If a patch or update is required, the system is merely replaced with a new system that is patched and updated." (Conklin)
  - Infrastructure as code
    - "Infrastructure as code is the use of code to build systems, rather than manually configur- ing them via normal configuration mechanisms. It is a way of using automation to build out systems, reproducible, efficient and is a key attribute of enabling best practices in DevOps." (Conklin)
