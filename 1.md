# 1.0 Threats, Attacks and Vulnerabilities

## 1.1 Given a scenario, analyze indicators of compromise and determine the type of malware. ([Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9827006#overview))

- Viruses ([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/12836596#overview))
  - "A virus is a piece of mali- cious code that replicates by attaching itself to another piece of executable code." (Conklin)
  - Armored. "Some malware, such as the Zeus Trojan, employs encryption in ways to prevent criminals from stealing the intellectual property of the very malware that they use." (Conklin)
- Crypto-malware ([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/12836594#overview))
  - "Crypto-malware is an early name given to malware that encrypts files on a system and then leaves them unusable either permanently, acting as a denial of service, or temporar- ily until a ransom is paid, making it ransomware." (Conklin)
- Ransomware ([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/12836640#overview))
  - "Ransomware is a form of malware that performs some action and extracts ransom from a user." (Conklin)
- Worm ([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/12836604#overview))

- Spyware ([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/12836642#overview))
  - "Spyware is software that “spies” on users, recording and reporting on their activities." (Conklin)
- Bots ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kA2ney8r1Y&list=PLG49S3nxzAnnVhoAaL4B6aMFDQ8_gdxAy&index=10))
  - "A bot is a functioning piece of software that performs some task, under the control of another program." (Conklin)
- RAT ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib8Phu54VYc&list=PLG49S3nxzAnnVhoAaL4B6aMFDQ8_gdxAy&index=6))
  - "A remote-access Trojan (RAT) is a toolkit designed to provide the capability of covert surveillance and/or the capability to gain unauthorized access to a target system." (Conklin)
- Logic bomb ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUemRyeKJs4&list=PLG49S3nxzAnnVhoAaL4B6aMFDQ8_gdxAy&index=11))
  - "A logic bomb is a piece of code that sits dormant for a period of time until some event or date invokes its malicious payload." (Conklin)
- Backdoor ([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/12838190#overview))
  - "Used to refer to programs that attackers install after gaining unauthorized access to a system to ensure that they can continue to have unrestricted access to the system, even if their initial access method is discovered and blocked." (Conklin)

- Types of actors
  - Script kiddies
    - Runs pre-made scripts
    - Might not know what they're doing
    - Not sophisticated
  - Hacktivist
    - Hacker with a purpose
    - Social change or political agenda
    - Can be sophisticated
    - Deface web site
    - Funding is limited
  - Organized crime
    - Outside of network
    - Usually motivated by money

  - Insiders
    - Has institutional knowledge
    - Knows what to hit
  - Competitors
    - DoS, espionage, harm reputation
    - High sophistication
- Attributes of actors
  - Internal/external
    - "Internal actors have access to the system... External actors have an additional step, the establishment of access to the system under attack." (Conklin)
  - Level of sophistication
    - "The greater the skill level the more an individual will be expected to lead and design the attacks." (Conklin)
  - Resources/funding
    - "Criminal organizations and nation states have larger budgets, big- ger teams, and the ability to pursue campaigns for longer periods of time." (Conklin)
  - Intent/motivation
- Use of open-source intelligence
  - "Open source intelligence, sometimes called open source threat intelligence, refers to intel- ligence data collected from public sources." (Conklin)

## 1.4 Explain penetration testing concepts. ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbVbqF-UmHc&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=40), [Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/12840126#overview), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9876496#overview))

- Passive reconnaissance
  - Gather information
  - Learn from open sources
    - Social media
    - Corporate web site
    - Reddit, forums
    - Social engineering
  - Doesn't require touching the equipment
- Active reconnaissance
  - Often done with vulnerability scan
  - Ping scans
  - Port scans
  - DNS queries
  - Service scans, version scans
- Exploiting vulnerabilities
  - Break into system
  - Gain privilege escalation
  - Be careful; can cause DoS or loss of data
  - Password bruce-force
  - Database injection
  - Buffer overflow
- Initial exploitation
  - Get into the network
  - A challenging hurdle (most of the time)
  - Secure way back in; backdoor
  - Build user accounts
- Pivot
  - Foothold point
  - Inside of network relatively open
  - Jump from here to rest of network
- Levels of information
  - Black box
    - Pentester knows nothing
    - Blind test
  - White box
    - Full disclosure
  - Grey box
    - Mix of black and white
    - Focus on certain applications
- Popular tool: Metasploit
- Escalation of privilege
  - "The movement from a lower-level account to an account that enables root-level activity." (Conklin)
- Persistence
  - "APT actors tend to be very patient and use techniques that make it very difficult to remove them once they have gained a foothold. Persistence can be achieved via a wide range of mechanisms, from agents that beacon back out, to malicious accounts, to vulnerabilities introduced to enable reinfection." (Conklin)
- Penetration testing vs. vulnerability scanning
  - Vulnerability scanning
    - See if vulnerability exists
  - Pentest
    - Simulates an attack
    - Tries to exploit
  - With DoS attack: "Penetration testing will give you a detailed account of whether a network has the capability to detect and respond to a denial-of-service attack." (uCertify)
  - Penetration testing: active
  - Vulnerability scanning: passive

## 1.5 Explain vulnerability scanning concepts. ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HukLd-6C4Ew&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=41), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9828984#overview))

- Identify lack of security controls
- Identify common misconfigurations
- Intrusive vs. non-intrusive scan
  - Non-intrusive
    - Don't exploit
    - Packet-capture & analysis
  - Intrusive
    - Try out vulnerability; don't takd advantage of it
- Credentialed vs. non-credentialed
  - Non-credentialed
    - No access, user/pass
  - Credentialed
    - Provided with user/pass
    - Emulates insider attack
- Identify vulnerability
  - Signature are the key
- False positive
  - Vulnerability identified that doesn't really exist
- False negatives
  - Vulnerability existed, but wasn't discovered
