- Metrics are the "best indication of the success of the program."
- 802.1X "makes use of a supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server".
- AES and TKIP are supported by the 802.11i standard.
- DRP: Data recovery plan
- "TEMPEST is a group of standards that refers to the investigations of conducted admissions from electrical and mechanical devices that may or may not compromise an organization."
  - "War-driving can be prevented by using TEMPEST-certified techniques. War-driving is when a person attempts to access a company's wireless network from a laptop within their vehicle."
- Logging
  - "The System log file logs information pertaining to drivers, operating system files, the kernel, and so on..."
  - "The firewall log can help you find out whether files are being illegitimately copied to an external location."
  - Security log
    - "The Security log file shows any unauthorized changes to the resources that you decide to audit."
    - "The security log is the log file in Windows (found in the Event Viewer) that shows security violations or allowed access whether they succeeded or not; it works when auditing has been turned on."

- RSA: "depends on the inability to factor large prime numbers"
- "Signatures are the patterns that an IDS looks for when detecting attacks."
- CRS is submitted to the certificate authority
- Nonessential services
  - Not monitored as oftne
  - Often not configured correctly
- "Message authentication code (MAC) is a short piece of information that authenticates the message in an attempt to guarantee the message's data integrity"
- "AES, DES, RC4, and 3DES are all symmetric encryption algorithms."
- Smurf: Occurs when a combination of IP spoofing and ICMP messages saturate a network.
- "Proper external security testing should be conducted from outside the organization's security perimeter."
- "MAC flooding sends many packets to a switch, each of which has a different source MAC address, in an attempt to use up the memory on the switch, changing the state of the switch to fail-open mode, which ultimately makes it function as a hub."
- "Kiting is the practice of monopolizing domain names without paying for them. Newly registered domain names can be canceled with a full refund during an initial five-day window known as an AGP, or add grace period."
- "WPA was created to fix core problems with WEP. WPA is designed to work with older wireless clients while implementing the 802.11i standard."
- CASB: Cloud Access Security Broker
  "If there is a mix of on-premises infrastructure and cloud-provider infrastructure, a company might consider a cloud access security broker (CASB). A CASB is a software tool or service that acts as the gatekeeper between the two, allowing the company to extend the reach of its security policies beyond its internal infrastructure."
- "TCP Wrapper is a host-based ACL program that provides protection against host name and host address spoofing in Linux and Unix environments."
