([Mike Meyers 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826382#overview), [Mike Meyers 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826412#overview))

- Standard operating procedure
  - "Standard operating procedures are... mandatory step-by-step instructions set by the organization so that in the performance of their duties, employees will meet the stated security objectives of the firm." (Conklin)
- Agreement types ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKoG2iGO9XI&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=99), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826448#overview))
  - BPA
    - "A business partnership agreement (BPA) is a legal agreement between partners that estab- lishes the terms, conditions, and expectations of the relationship between the partners." (Conklin)
  - SLA
    - "A service level agreement (SLA) is a negotiated agreement between parties detailing the expectations between a customer and a service provider. SLAs essentially set the requisite level of performance of a given contractual service." (Conklin)
  - ISA
    - "An interconnection security agreement (ISA) is a specialized agreement between organiza- tions that have interconnected IT systems, the purpose of which is to document the secu- rity requirements associated with the interconnection." (Conklin)
  - MOU/MOA
    - "A memorandum of understanding (MOU) and memorandum of agreement (MOA) are legal documents used to describe a bilateral agreement between parties. It is a written agreement expressing a set of intended actions between the parties with respect to some common pursuit or goal." (Conklin)

  - Mandatory vacations
    - "Requiring employees to use their vacation time through a policy of mandatory vacations can be a security protection mechanism. Using mandatory vacations as a tool to detect fraud will require that somebody else also be trained in the functions of the employee who is on vacation." (Conklin)
  - Job rotation
    - "Rotating through jobs provides individuals with a better perspective of how the various parts of the organization can enhance (or hinder) the business... If all security tasks are the domain of one employee, security will suffer if that individual is lost from the organization." (Conklin)
  - Separation of duties
    - "Ensure[s] that no single individual has the ability to conduct transactions alone. This means that the level of trust in any one individual is lessened, and the ability for any individual to cause catastrophic damage to the organization is also lessened." (Conklin)
  - Clean desk
    - "Policy specifying that sensitive information must not be left unsecured in the work area when the worker is not present to act as custodian." (Conklin)
  - Background checks
    - "Background checks can validate previous employment, criminal backgrounds, and financial background." (Conklin)

  - "Needed to ensure that the individual understands the responsibilities as they relate to information security." (Conklin)
  - Data owner
  - System administrator
    - "System administrators are administrative users with the responsibility of maintaining a system within its defined requirements." (Conklin)
  - System owner
  - User
  - Privileged user
  - Executive user
    - "Limiting the access of executives is not meant to limit their work, but rather limit the range of damage should an account become compromised." (Conklin)
  - NDA
    - "Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are standard corporate documents used to explain the boundaries of company secret material, information which control over should be exer- cised to prevent disclosure to unauthorized parties." (Conklin)
