# 5.0 Risk Management

## 5.1 Explain the importance of policies, plans and procedures related to organizational security. ([Mike Meyers 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826382#overview), [Mike Meyers 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826412#overview))

- Standard operating procedure
  - "Standard operating procedures are... mandatory step-by-step instructions set by the organization so that in the performance of their duties, employees will meet the stated security objectives of the firm." (Conklin)
- Agreement types ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKoG2iGO9XI&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=99), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826448#overview))
  - BPA
    - "A business partnership agreement (BPA) is a legal agreement between partners that estab- lishes the terms, conditions, and expectations of the relationship between the partners." (Conklin)
  - SLA
    - "A service level agreement (SLA) is a negotiated agreement between parties detailing the expectations between a customer and a service provider. SLAs essentially set the requisite level of performance of a given contractual service." (Conklin)
  - ISA
    - "An interconnection security agreement (ISA) is a specialized agreement between organiza- tions that have interconnected IT systems, the purpose of which is to document the secu- rity requirements associated with the interconnection." (Conklin)
  - MOU/MOA
    - "A memorandum of understanding (MOU) and memorandum of agreement (MOA) are legal documents used to describe a bilateral agreement between parties. It is a written agreement expressing a set of intended actions between the parties with respect to some common pursuit or goal." (Conklin)
- Personnel management ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvqFFlG4KMc&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=100))
  - Mandatory vacations
    - "Requiring employees to use their vacation time through a policy of mandatory vacations can be a security protection mechanism. Using mandatory vacations as a tool to detect fraud will require that somebody else also be trained in the functions of the employee who is on vacation." (Conklin)
  - Job rotation
    - "Rotating through jobs provides individuals with a better perspective of how the various parts of the organization can enhance (or hinder) the business... If all security tasks are the domain of one employee, security will suffer if that individual is lost from the organization." (Conklin)
  - Separation of duties
    - "Ensure[s] that no single individual has the ability to conduct transactions alone. This means that the level of trust in any one individual is lessened, and the ability for any individual to cause catastrophic damage to the organization is also lessened." (Conklin)
  - Clean desk
    - "Policy specifying that sensitive information must not be left unsecured in the work area when the worker is not present to act as custodian." (Conklin)
  - Background checks
    - "Background checks can validate previous employment, criminal backgrounds, and financial background." (Conklin)
  - Exit interviews
- Role-based awareness training ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7t2XKwH4M&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=101), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826426#overview))
  - "Needed to ensure that the individual understands the responsibilities as they relate to information security." (Conklin)
  - Data owner
  - System administrator
    - "System administrators are administrative users with the responsibility of maintaining a system within its defined requirements." (Conklin)
  - System owner
  - User
  - Privileged user
  - Executive user
    - "Limiting the access of executives is not meant to limit their work, but rather limit the range of damage should an account become compromised." (Conklin)
  - NDA
    - "Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are standard corporate documents used to explain the boundaries of company secret material, information which control over should be exer- cised to prevent disclosure to unauthorized parties." (Conklin)
  - Onboarding
    - "Ensure[s] that the personnel are aware of and understand their responsibilities with respect to securing company information and assets." (Conklin)

- Single point of failure
- Impact
  - Life
  - Property
  - Safety

  - Reputation
- Privacy threshold assessment
  - "A privacy threshold assessment is an analysis of whether PII is collected and maintained by a system. If PII is stored, then the next step in determining privacy risk is a privacy impact assessment, PIA, covered in the preceding section." (Conklin)
  - "Determine if privacy impact assessment is required." (Messer)
- Privacy impact assessment (PIA)
  - "A privacy impact assessment (PIA) is a structured approach to determining the gap between desired privacy performance and actual privacy performance. A PIA is an analysis of how personally identifiable information (PII) is handled through business processes and an assessment of risks to the PII during storage, use, and communication." (Conklin)
  - "Ensures compliance with privacy laws and regulations." (Messer)

    1. Record each item collected as evidence.
    2. Record who collected the evidence along with the date and time it was collected or recorded.
    3. Write a description of the evidence in the documentation.
    4. Put the evidence in containers and tag the containers with the case number, the name of the person who collected it, and the date and time it was collected or put in the container.
    5. Record all message digest (hash) values in the documentation.
    6. Securely transport the evidence to a protected storage facility.
    7. Obtain a signature from the person who accepts the evidence at this storage facility.
    8. Provide controls to prevent access to and compromise of the evidence while it is being stored.
    9. Securely transport the evidence to court for proceedings.
- Legal hold
  - A "litigation hold, the process by which you properly preserve any and all digital evidence related to a potential case. This event is usually triggered by one organization issuing a litigation hold request to another. Once an organization receives this notice, it is required to maintain a complete set of unaltered data including metadata, of any and all information related to the issue causing the litigation hold."
