# 2.0 Technologies and Tools

## 2.1 Install and configure network components, both hardware and software-based, to support organizational security. ([Mike Meyers 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826954#overview), [Mike Meyers 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826972#overview))

- Firewall ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDKKqPxMpb0&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=43))
  - Keeps bad traffic from coming in; sometimes from leaving too
  - Controls traffic flow
  - Content control as well
    - Inappropriate content
    - Malware
  - Application-based vs. network-based
    - "Application-based firewalls (aka application-layer firewalls) can analyze traffic at an even deeper level, examining the application characteristics of traffic and blocking specific actions while allowing others, even inside web-connected applications. This gives application-based firewalls much greater specificity than network-based firewalls that only look at IP addresses and ports." (Conklin)
  - Stateful vs. stateless
    - Stateless
      - Doesn't keep track of sessions
      - Packet filter
    - Stateful
      - Keep track of what traffic flows are active
      - "A stateful packet inspection firewall can act upon the state condition of a conversation—is this a new conversation or a continuation of a conversation, and did it originate inside or outside the firewall?" (Conklin)
  - ACL
    - Rules for allow/disallow
    - "Access control lists (ACLs) are lists of users and their permitted actions." (Conklin)
  - Implicit deny
    - Prevents "any traffic from passing that is not specifically recognized as allowed." (Conklin)
- VPN concentrator ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxBQZQM-RNk&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=44))
  - Remote access vs. site-to-site
    - "When the VPN is set up to connect specific machines between two networks on an ongoing basis, with no setup per communication required, it is referred to as a site-to-site VPN configuration. If the VPN connection is designed to allow remote hosts to connect to a network, they are called remote access VPNs." (Conklin)
  - IPSec ([Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9827094#overview))
    - Authentication and encryption for every packet.
    - Integrity check: Anti-replay
    - Transport mode
      - Data is encrypted
      - IPSec headers and trailers
      - Original IP header used
    - Tunnel mode
      - Both IP header and data are encrypted
      - Completely different IPSec header put on front of packet
    - AH: Authentication header
      - "The AH, when added to an IP datagram, ensures the integrity of the data and also the authenticity of the data’s origin." (Conklin)
    - ESP: Encapsulating Security Payload
      - "Provides security services for the higher-level protocol portion of the packet only, not the IP header." (Conklin)
  - Split tunnel vs. full tunnel
    - "Split tunnel is a form of VPN where not all traffic is routed via the VPN." (Conklin)
    - "A full tunnel solution routes all traffic over the VPN, providing protection to all networking traffic." (Conklin)
  - TLS ([Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9827352#overview))
    - "TLS-based VPNs have some advantages over IPSec-based VPNs when networks are heavily NAT encoded, because IPSec-based VPNs can have issues crossing multiple NAT domains." (Conklin)
  - Always-on VPN
    - They use "pre-established connection parameters and automation. Always-on VPNs can self-configure and connect once an Internet connection is sensed and provide VPN functionality without user intervention." (Conklin)
- NIPS/NIDS ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEgWPWIuq_s&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=45), [Jason Dion 1](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13214946#overview), [Jason Dion 2](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219720#overview), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9827100#overview))

          - The switch is not wireless-aware
        - Thin
          - Just enough to be 802.11 wireless
          - The intelligence is in the switch
          - Less expensive
- SIEM: Security Information and Management ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JTjVa0IM7o&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=50), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9827104#overview))
  - Logging of security events and information
  - Aggregation
    - "The collecting of information in a central place, in a common format, to facilitate analysis and decision making." (Conklin)
  - Correlation
    - "The connection of events based on some common basis. Events can cor- relate based on time, based on common events, based on behaviors, and so on. Although correlation is not necessarily causation, it is still useful to look for patterns, and then use these patterns to find future issues." (Conklin)

  - Host health checks
    - "Some common host health checks include verifying an antivirus solution is present, has the latest patches, and has been run recently, and verifying that the OS and applications are patched." (Conklin)
  - Agent vs. agentless
    - "In agent-based solutions, code is stored on the host machine for activation and use at time of connection. In agentless solutions, the code resides on the network and is deployed to memory for use in a machine requesting connections, but since it never persists on the host machine, it is referred to as agentless." (Conklin)
  - "Computers must have the authentication agent installed; otherwise, the NAC system will not ask for the credentials." (uCertify)

- SSL/TLS accelerators ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGI_TylnBuc&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=54))
  - Asymmetric encryption is hard
    - Much more computationally intense than symmetric encryption
    - Accelerator offloads the process
  - "Includes hardware-based SSL/TLS operations to handle the throughput, and it acts as a transparent device between the web server and the Internet. When an enterprise experiences web server bottlenecks due to SSL/TLS demands, an accelerator can be an economical solution." (Conklin)
