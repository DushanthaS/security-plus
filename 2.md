# 2.0 Technologies and Tools

## 2.1 Install and configure network components, both hardware and software-based, to support organizational security. ([Mike Meyers 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826954#overview), [Mike Meyers 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826972#overview))

- Firewall ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDKKqPxMpb0&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=43))
  - Keeps bad traffic from coming in; sometimes from leaving too
  - Controls traffic flow
  - Content control as well
    - Inappropriate content
    - Malware
  - Application-based vs. network-based
    - "Application-based firewalls (aka application-layer firewalls) can analyze traffic at an even deeper level, examining the application characteristics of traffic and blocking specific actions while allowing others, even inside web-connected applications. This gives application-based firewalls much greater specificity than network-based firewalls that only look at IP addresses and ports." (Conklin)
  - Stateful vs. stateless
    - Stateless
      - Doesn't keep track of sessions
      - Packet filter
    - Stateful
      - Keep track of what traffic flows are active
      - "A stateful packet inspection firewall can act upon the state condition of a conversation—is this a new conversation or a continuation of a conversation, and did it originate inside or outside the firewall?" (Conklin)
  - ACL
    - Rules for allow/disallow
    - "Access control lists (ACLs) are lists of users and their permitted actions." (Conklin)
  - Implicit deny
    - Prevents "any traffic from passing that is not specifically recognized as allowed." (Conklin)
- VPN concentrator ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxBQZQM-RNk&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=44))
  - Remote access vs. site-to-site
    - "When the VPN is set up to connect specific machines between two networks on an ongoing basis, with no setup per communication required, it is referred to as a site-to-site VPN configuration. If the VPN connection is designed to allow remote hosts to connect to a network, they are called remote access VPNs." (Conklin)
  - IPSec ([Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9827094#overview))
    - Authentication and encryption for every packet.
    - Integrity check: Anti-replay
    - Transport mode
      - Data is encrypted
      - IPSec headers and trailers
      - Original IP header used
    - Tunnel mode
      - Both IP header and data are encrypted
      - Completely different IPSec header put on front of packet
    - AH: Authentication header
      - "The AH, when added to an IP datagram, ensures the integrity of the data and also the authenticity of the data’s origin." (Conklin)
    - ESP: Encapsulating Security Payload
      - "Provides security services for the higher-level protocol portion of the packet only, not the IP header." (Conklin)
  - Split tunnel vs. full tunnel
    - "Split tunnel is a form of VPN where not all traffic is routed via the VPN." (Conklin)
    - "A full tunnel solution routes all traffic over the VPN, providing protection to all networking traffic." (Conklin)
  - TLS ([Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9827352#overview))
    - "TLS-based VPNs have some advantages over IPSec-based VPNs when networks are heavily NAT encoded, because IPSec-based VPNs can have issues crossing multiple NAT domains." (Conklin)
  - Always-on VPN
    - They use "pre-established connection parameters and automation. Always-on VPNs can self-configure and connect once an Internet connection is sensed and provide VPN functionality without user intervention." (Conklin)
- NIPS/NIDS ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEgWPWIuq_s&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=45), [Jason Dion 1](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13214946#overview), [Jason Dion 2](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219720#overview), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9827100#overview))
  - Inline vs. passive
    - Passive
      - No way to block traffic
      - Receives copy of traffic
      - Isn't sitting in middle of traffic
    - Inline
      - Traffic passes through
      - May be dropped
  - In-band vs. out-of-band

  - A router forwards traffic between IP subnets
  - Layer 3 devices
    - They make decisions on the network level on the OSI model
    - Typically "layer 2" is referring to a switch
    - Routers inside of switches sometimes called "layer 3 switches"
  - ACLs: Access Control Lists
    - Used to allow or deny traffic
    - Evaluate traffic on certain criteria
      - Source IP, destination IP, TCP port numbers, UDP port numbers, ICMP
  - Antispoofing
    - Prevent others from using someone else's address
    - Man-in-the-middle, DDoS
    - Filter reserved IP addresses
    - RPF: Reverse Path Forwarding
      - The response to an inbound packet should return the same way
      - If it doesn't, then drop the packet right now
- Switch ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Tmo1RgF3E&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=46), [Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13140484#overview))

  - Receives the user requests and sends the request on their behalf (the proxy)
  - Useful for caching information, access control, URL filtering, content scanning
  - Modes of operation
    - Explicit proxy

    - A wireless router is a router and a WAP in a single device
    - WAP is a bridge
      - Extends the wired network onto the wireless network
      - An OSI layer 2 device
  - SSID: Service Set Identifier
    - Name of the wireless network

        - Thick
          - The access point handles most wireless tasks
          - The switch is not wireless-aware
        - Thin
          - Just enough to be 802.11 wireless
          - The intelligence is in the switch
          - Less expensive
- SIEM: Security Information and Management ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JTjVa0IM7o&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=50), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9827104#overview))
  - Logging of security events and information
  - Aggregation
    - "The collecting of information in a central place, in a common format, to facilitate analysis and decision making." (Conklin)
  - Correlation
    - "The connection of events based on some common basis. Events can cor- relate based on time, based on common events, based on behaviors, and so on. Although correlation is not necessarily causation, it is still useful to look for patterns, and then use these patterns to find future issues." (Conklin)
