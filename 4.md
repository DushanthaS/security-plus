# 4.0 Identity and Access Management

## 4.1 Compare and contrast identity and access management concepts ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNQXoxeQYiU&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=90), [Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219566#overview), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826746#overview))

- Identification, authentication,
  authorization and accounting (AAA) ([Keith Barker](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/learn/it-training/playlist/nrn:playlist:certification:5b5b6ecb4c71f356450e6ad1/68?autostart=1))
  - Identification: Who you claim to be
  - Authentication: Prove who you say you are
  - Authorization: What access do you have?
  - Accounting: Resourced used; log
- Multifactor authentication ([Keith Barker](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/learn/it-training/playlist/nrn:playlist:certification:5b5b6ecb4c71f356450e6ad1/70?autostart=1))

  - One-way trust: Domain B trusts domain A; domain A does not trust domain B
  - Two-way trust: Both trust each other equally
  - Non-transitive trust: "A trust is specifically created and applies only to that domain."
  - Transitive trust: Domain A trust B, B trusts C, therefore A trusts C

## 4.2 Given a scenario, install and configure identity and access services. ([James Messer 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7go75lBi0w&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=91), [James Messer 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20X8WVwvUh4&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=92), [James Messer 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs-7mAdEMek&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=93), [Mike Meyers 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826802#overview), [Mike Meyers 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826808#overview), [Mike Meyers 3](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826814#overview))

- LDAP ([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219576#overview))
  - X.500 specification
  - X.500 Directory Information Tree
    - Container objects
    - Leaf objects
  - "Common uses of directories include e-mail address lists, domain server data, and resource maps of network resources." (Conklin)
  - Uses tcp/389 and udp/389. When encrypted: 636.
  - Microsoft's implementation: Active Directory.
- Kerberos ([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219576#overview))
  - Uses a system of tickets.
  - Uses time stamps.
  - Mutual authentication. Protected from man-in-the-middle or replay attacks.
  - "Supported by all major operating systems." (Conklin)
  - "Built around the idea of a trusted third party, termed a key distribution center (KDC), which consists of two logically separate parts: an authentication server (AS) and a ticket-granting server (TGS)." (Conklin)
  - Port 88
- TACACS+ ([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219620#overview))
  - Similar to RADIUS.
  - "TACACS+ has three types of accounting records: START, STOP, and UPDATE." (Conklin)
  - TACACS -> XTACACS (Cisco) -> TACACS+ (open standard)
- Non-ethernet networks
  - PPP
  - PPTP
  - PPPoE
- For authenticating over non-Ethernet networks
  - PAP ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20X8WVwvUh4&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=92))
    - Password Authentication Protocol
    - Legacy; no encryption
  - CHAP ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20X8WVwvUh4&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=92))
    - Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol
      - Encrypted challenge sent over the network
      - Three-way handshake
  - MSCHAP ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20X8WVwvUh4&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=92))
    - Microsoft's implementation of CHAP
      - Used commonly on Microsoft's PPTP
    - MSCHAP v2
    - Security issues due to DES
    - Many have migrated to L2TP, IPsec, or other secure VPN tech
- RADIUS ([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219620#overview))
  - "Connectionless protocol utilizing User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its transport-level protocol... RADIUS utilizes UDP ports 1812 for authentication and authorization and 1813 for accounting functions. RADIUS is a client/server protocol. The RADIUS client is typically a network access server (NAS)." (Conklin)
  - "Communications between a RADIUS client and RADIUS server are encrypted using a shared secret that is manually configured into each entity and not shared over a connection... Communications between a user (typically a PC) and the RADIUS client are subject to compromise." (Conklin)
- OpenID Connect
- OAuth
  - Provides resource authorization. Usually combined with OpenID Connect.
- SAML
  - Wasn't designed for mobile applications.
- Shibboleth
  - Open source implementation of SAML
- Secure token ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs-7mAdEMek&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=93))
- NTLM
  - "NT LAN Manager (NTLM), also known as Windows Challenge/Response" (Conklin)
  - Was "successor to the authentication protocol in Microsoft LAN Manager (LANMAN)" (Conklin)
  - "Both of these suites have been widely replaced by Microsoft’s Kerberos implementation, although NTLM is still used for logon authentication on stand-alone Windows machines." (Conklin)
  - "NTLM uses an encrypted challenge/ response protocol to authenticate a user without sending the user’s password over the wire, but the cryptography used for this, MD4, is considered weak and deprecated by today’s standards." (Conklin)

## 4.3 Given a scenario, implement identity and access management controls. ([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219636#overview), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826754#overview))

- Access control models ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ8GDSUUvPY&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=94), [Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219640#overview), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826764#overview))
  - Policy definition: Process of determining rights
  - MAC: Mandatory Access Control
    - OS limits the operation on object based on clearance levels
    - Every object gets a label (e.g. confidential, secret)
    - Admin decides who gets what security level
  - DAC: Discretionary Access Control
    - Used in most OS
    - Owner controls who else has access
    - Owner can modify access
    - Flexible
  - RBAC: Role-based access control
    - Admin determines access
    - Based on role in organization
    - e.g. manager, director, team lead, project manager
    - Rights are implicit
    - In Windows, use Groups to provide role-based access control
  - ABAC: Attribute access control
    - Users can have complex relationships to applications and data
    - Aware of context
    - May consider IP address, time of day, desired action, etc
  - Rule-based access control
    - "Access is determined through system-enforced rules." (Messer)
    - Determined by system administrator, not users
- File system security ([Mike Meyers 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826782#overview), [Mike Meyers 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826786#overview))
  - ACL
  - Group/user rights and permissions
  - "Can be centrally administered and/or users can manage files they own." (Messer)
  - Encryption can be built-in
- Database security
  - Username, password, permissions
  - Most databases support encryption
  - Data integrity is usually an option
  - Prevent SQL injections
- Physical access control ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ2voph67v8&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=95))
  - Proximity cards
    - Close range card
      - Contactless smart card
    - Passive device
      - Powered inductively from reader
    - Not a large data storage device
  - Smart cards
    - More intelligent
    - Contactless or contact-mode
    - A digital certificate
- Biometric factors ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ2voph67v8&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=95))
  - Fingerprint scanner
  - Retinal scanner
    - Unique capillary structure in the back of the eye
  - Iris scanner
    - Texture, color
  - Voice recognition
  - Facial recognition
  - FAR: False acceptance rate
    - "Likelihood an unauthorized user will be accepted." (Messer)
  - FRR: False rejection rate
    - "Likelihood an authorized user will be rejected." (Messer)
  - CER: Crossover error rate
    - Rate at which FAR and FRR are equal
    - "Adjust sensitivity to equalize both values." (Messer)
- Tokens, token generators
  - Pseudo-random token generators
  - Hardware
  - Software
  - One-time passwords
  - HOTP: HMAC-based one-time password algorithm
    - Keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC)
    - "The keys are based on a secret key and a counter." (Messer)
  - TOTP: Time-based one-time password algorithm
    - "The Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm is a specific implementation of an HOTP that uses a secret key with a current timestamp to generate a one-time password." (Conklin)
- Certificate-based authentication
  - "A digital certificate is a digital file that is sent as an attachment to a message and is used to verify that the message did indeed come from the entity it claims to have come from. Using a digital certificate is a verifiable means of establishing possession of an item, specifically the certificate." (Conklin)
  - PIV
    - "The Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card is a U.S. government smart card that contains the cardholder’s credential data used to determine access to federal facilities and information systems." (Conklin)
  - CAC/smart card
    - "The Common Access Card (CAC) is a smart card used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for active-duty military, Selected Reserve members, DoD civilians, and eligible contractors. Like the PIV card, it is used for carrying the card- holder’s credential data, in the form of a certificate, used to determine access to federal facilities and information systems." (Conklin)
  - IEEE 802.1x
    - "802.1X acts through an intermediate device, such as an edge switch, enabling ports to carry normal traffic if the connection is properly authenticated. This prevents unauthorized clients from accessing the publicly available ports on a switch, keeping unauthorized users out of a LAN." (Conklin)

## 4.4 Given a scenario, differentiate common account management practices. ([Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826774#overview))

- Account types ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP-UR4dcQTA&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=96), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826792#overview))
  - User account
  - Shared and generic
    accounts/credentials
  - Guest accounts
  - Service accounts
  - Privileged accounts
- General Concepts ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj9Tfg9UeOY&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=97))
  - Least privilege
  - Onboarding/offboarding
  - Permission auditing and review
  - Usage auditing and review
  - Time-of-day restrictions
  - Recertification
  - Standard naming convention
  - Account maintenance
  - Group-based access control
  - Location-based policies
- Account policy enforcement ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hasbtq2LS9c&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=98))
  - Credential management
    - "Refers to the processes, services, and software used to store, manage, and log the use of user credentials." (Conklin)
  - Group policy
    - Group Policy objects (GPOs)
    - "GPOs act through a set of registry settings that can be managed via the enterprise." (Conklin)
  - Password complexity
  - Expiration
    - "Account expiration should occur when a user is no longer authorized to use a system." (Conklin)
    - All passwords should expire (Messer).
  - Recovery
    - Should not be trivial.
  - Disablement
    - "Whenever an employee leaves a firm, all associated accounts should be disabled to prevent further access by the ex-employee. Disabling is preferable to removal as removal may result in permission and ownership problems. Removing an account can orphan items that remain without other forms of ownership, making it more difficult to share the former employee’s files." (Conklin)
  - Lockout
    - "Account lockout is akin to disablement, although lockout typically refers to temporarily blocking the user’s ability to log in to a system. For example, if a user mistypes her pass- word a certain number of times, she may be forced to wait a set amount of time while her account is locked out before attempting to log in again." (Conklin)
  - Password history
  - Password reuse
  - Password length
