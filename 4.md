- Identification, authentication,
  authorization and accounting (AAA)
  - Identification: Who you claim to be
  - Authentication: Prove who you say you are
  - Authorization: What access do you have?
  - Accounting: Resourced used; log
- Multifactor authentication
  - Something you are
    - Biometric
  - Something you have (Type II)
    - Smart card
    - USB token
    - Phone
  - Something you know
    - Password
    - PIN
    - Pattern
  - Somewhere you are
    - Geography
    - IPv4 address
    - GPS
  - Something you do
    - Signature comparison
    - Handwriting
    - Typing technique; delays between keystrokes
- Federation
  - Partners, supplies
  - Facebook, Twitter credentials
  - Third parties must establish a trust relationship
- Single sign-on ([Mike Chapple](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-security-plus-sy0-501-cert-prep-4-identity-and-access-management/single-sign-on-and-federation?autoSkip=true&contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A57bdd64992015ae4c0cb990e&resume=false&u=2045532))
  - Windows: Kerberos
- Transitive trust
  - One-way trust: Domain B trusts domain A; domain A does not trust domain B
  - Two-way trust: Both trust each other equally
  - Non-transitive trust: "A trust is specifically created and applies only to that domain."
  - Transitive trust: Domain A trust B, B trusts C, therefore A trusts C

  - "Connectionless protocol utilizing User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its transport-level protocol... RADIUS utilizes UDP ports 1812 for authentication and authorization and 1813 for accounting functions. RADIUS is a client/server protocol. The RADIUS client is typically a network access server (NAS)." (Conklin)
  - "Communications between a RADIUS client and RADIUS server are encrypted using a shared secret that is manually configured into each entity and not shared over a connection... Communications between a user (typically a PC) and the RADIUS client are subject to compromise." (Conklin)
  - "Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) provides centralized remote user authentication, authorization, and accounting." (uCertify)
  - "The Diameter protocol is, like RADIUS, another AAA protocol, but is a more evolved protocol and utilizes more reliable transport mechanisms such as TCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as opposed to UDP." (uCertify)
- OpenID Connect ([Mike Chapple](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-security-plus-sy0-501-cert-prep-4-identity-and-access-management/oauth-and-openid-connect?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A57bdd64992015ae4c0cb990e&resume=false&u=2045532))

  - "NT LAN Manager (NTLM), also known as Windows Challenge/Response" (Conklin)
  - Was "successor to the authentication protocol in Microsoft LAN Manager (LANMAN)" (Conklin)
  - "Both of these suites have been widely replaced by Microsoft’s Kerberos implementation, although NTLM is still used for logon authentication on stand-alone Windows machines." (Conklin)
  - "NTLM uses an encrypted challenge/ response protocol to authenticate a user without sending the user’s password over the wire, but the cryptography used for this, MD4, is considered weak and deprecated by today’s standards." (Conklin)
  - NTLM2 uses MD5 (not recommended)

## 4.3 Given a scenario, implement identity and access management controls. ([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219636#overview), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826754#overview))

    - OS limits the operation on object based on clearance levels
    - Every object gets a label (e.g. confidential, secret)
    - Admin decides who gets what security level
    - Strict
    - "Mandatory access control (MAC) has two common implementations: rule-based access control and lattice-based access control. Lattice-based access control is used for more complex determinations of object access by subjects..." (uCertify)

    - "Works with sets of permissions, instead of individual permissions that are label-based." (uCertify)
    - Admin determines access
    - Based on role in organization
    - e.g. manager, director, team lead, project manager
    - Rights are implicit
    - In Windows, use Groups to provide role-based access control

  - "A digital certificate is a digital file that is sent as an attachment to a message and is used to verify that the message did indeed come from the entity it claims to have come from. Using a digital certificate is a verifiable means of establishing possession of an item, specifically the certificate." (Conklin)
  - PIV

  - IEEE 802.1x
    - "802.1X acts through an intermediate device, such as an edge switch, enabling ports to carry normal traffic if the connection is properly authenticated. This prevents unauthorized clients from accessing the publicly available ports on a switch, keeping unauthorized users out of a LAN." (Conklin)

## 4.4 Given a scenario, differentiate common account management practices. ([Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826774#overview))

  - Least Privilege
    - The principle of least privilege
  - Need to Know
    - The principle of need to know is similar to the principle of least privilege in that users are granted access only to the data and information that they need to know for their job

- Account types ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP-UR4dcQTA&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=96), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826792#overview), [Mike Chapple](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-security-plus-sy0-501-cert-prep-4-identity-and-access-management/account-types?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A57bdd64992015ae4c0cb990e&resume=false&u=2045532))
  - User account
    - "An account on a computer associated with a specific person." (Messer)
    - Has limited access to OS.
  - Shared and generic accounts/credentials

    - Needs to be highly secured
    - Strong passwords, 2FA
- General Concepts ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj9Tfg9UeOY&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=97))
  - Least privilege
    - Basre minimum.
    - Only whats needed to complete objective.
  - Onboarding
    - Hires, transfers
    - IT agreements
    - Create accounts
    - Provide hardware
  - Off-boarding
    - Process should be pre-planned
    - Account deactivated, not deleted
  - Permission auditing and review

    - "Does everyone have the correct permissions?" (Messer)
    - Scheduled recertification
  - Usage auditing and review
    - How are resources used?
    - Are systems secure?
  - Time-of-day restrictions
  - Recertification
    - "Recertification is the process of examining a user's permissions and determining if they still need access to what was previously granted." (uCertify)
    - "The best reason to recertify is to audit permissions." (Dion)
    - "The most important principle in managing account permissions is the account recertification." (Dion)
  - Standard naming convention
    - Username should be unique
    - "Usernames should not describe a role or status." (Messer)
    - "Use the same username for the duration of employment." (Messer)
    - Memorable
  - Account maintenance
    - Resets
    - Forced updates

    - GPS, mobile devices, accurate
    - 802.11 wireless, less accurate
    - IP address, not very accurate
    - In/out office
    - Rules which block traffic from country
- Account policy enforcement ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hasbtq2LS9c&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=98),[Mike Chapple](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-security-plus-sy0-501-cert-prep-4-identity-and-access-management/account-policies?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A57bdd64992015ae4c0cb990e&resume=false&u=2045532))
  - Credential management
    - "Refers to the processes, services, and software used to store, manage, and log the use of user credentials." (Conklin)
  - Group policy
    - Add or remove programs
    - Prohibit changes
    - Specify minimum password length
    - Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
    - "GPOs act through a set of registry settings that can be managed via the enterprise." (Conklin)
  - Password complexity
    - No single words
    - Mix upper and lower case
    - Use special characters
  - Expiration
    - "Account expiration should occur when a user is no longer authorized to use a system." (Conklin)
    - All passwords should expire (Messer).
  - Recovery
    - Should not be trivial.
  - Disablement
    - "Whenever an employee leaves a firm, all associated accounts should be disabled to prevent further access by the ex-employee. Disabling is preferable to removal as removal may result in permission and ownership problems. Removing an account can orphan items that remain without other forms of ownership, making it more difficult to share the former employee’s files." (Conklin)
  - Lockout
    - "Account lockout is akin to disablement, although lockout typically refers to temporarily blocking the user’s ability to log in to a system. For example, if a user mistypes her password a certain number of times, she may be forced to wait a set amount of time while her account is locked out before attempting to log in again." (Conklin)
  - Password history
    - "Tells the system how many passwords to remember and does not allow a user to reuse an old password in that list." (Conklin)
  - Password reuse
    - Prevent password reuse
  - Password length
    - Strong: at least 8 characters
